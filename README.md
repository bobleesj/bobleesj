### My interests

During my spare time, I volunteer and collaborate with Dr. Anton Oliynyk and his students from CUNY Hunter College to generate geometric and compositional features, and build tools for filtering, preprocessing, and merging crystal data. 

| # | Tool Name                                   | Description                                                                                                     |

| 1 | CIF Bond Analyzer (CBA)                     | Computes the minimum atomic bonding distances from sites, generating histograms and pair counts.                 |
| 2 | Structure Analyzer/Featurizer (SAF)         | Generates geometric features of interatomic distances, atomic environment information, and coordination numbers. |
| 3 | Composition Analyzer/Featurizer (CAF)       | Generates chemical compositional features and provides tools for filtering, sorting, and merging data.           |
| 4 | CIF Cleaner                                 | Formats .cif files and sorts them based on tags, supercell size, and minimum distance                           |

### Education

I am currently enrolled in the M.S. **Materials Science and Engineering** program with a concentration in Materials Theory and Simulations at Columbia University advised by Dr. Renata Wentzcovitch.

Prior to Columbia, I earned a B.E. in **Chemical Engineering** with minors in **Computer Science** and **Chemistry** from The Cooper Union. I engaged in three semesters of supervised research on Monte Carlo geometry optimization and open-source development advised by Dr. Robert Topper.

I have completed graduate-level coursework such as Deep Learning ([ECE 472](https://cooper.edu/engineering/courses/electrical-and-computer-engineering-graduate/ece-472)) and Natural Language Processing ([ECE 467](https://cooper.edu/engineering/courses/electrical-and-computer-engineering-graduate/ece-467)).

### Upcoming tips

I will be presenting a poster at the following events:

- Deep Modeling for Molecular Simulation 2024, Princeton University, June 25-28, 2024
- Gordon Research Conference (GRC) Solid-State Chemistry, New Hampshire, July 20-26, 2024
