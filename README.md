### My interests

During my spare time, I collaborate with Dr. Anton Oliynyk from CUNY Hunter College. I generate geometric/compositional features and build user-interactive research tools for filtering, preprocessing, and merging crystal data.

### Blog

I document my learning and share my personal essays here: https://bobleesj.github.io/blog

### Education

I am currently enrolled in the M.S. **Materials Science and Engineering** program with a concentration in Materials Theory and Simulations at Columbia University, advised by Dr. Simon Billinge.

Prior to Columbia, I earned a B.E. in **Chemical Engineering** with minors in **Computer Science** and **Chemistry** from The Cooper Union. There, I conducted three semesters of supervised research on Monte Carlo geometry optimization and open-source development, advised by Dr. Robert Topper.

I completed graduate-level coursework in Deep Learning ([ECE 472](https://cooper.edu/engineering/courses/electrical-and-computer-engineering-graduate/ece-472)) and Natural Language Processing ([ECE 467](https://cooper.edu/engineering/courses/electrical-and-computer-engineering-graduate/ece-467)). My other relevant graduate coursework includes Polymers, Phonons, Electrons, Condensed Matter Physics, Thermodynamics, and Numerical Analysis.

Features implemented in CIF Bond Analyzer!
